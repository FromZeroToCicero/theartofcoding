# Master key programming tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you’re considering a career in computer science or programming, at the minimum, you’ll need to master key programming tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. According to a report from the job search site Indeed, in 2018, JavaScript and HTML were among the top 10 most in-demand programming languages for U.S. jobs. The coding languages were ranked based on the percentage of job listings that contained their name. So within the 'tech software' category on Indeed, JavaScript was mentioned in 26 percent of job listings and HTML was mentioned in 18 percent of listings.
